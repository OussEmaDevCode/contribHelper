# contribHelper
Simple bash script that makes it easier to contribute to a github repository.

# Steps
After successfully forking and cloning any repository, start doing the changes you were intending to do in the first place then
once you finished just open this script witch will make it easier to contribute, so that instead of running 6 individual command
you'll just write the directory path, branch name and commit name.

Note: this will only work on windows and some versions of linux.
